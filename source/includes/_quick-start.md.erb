# Quick start

A quick start example of using [Endpass Connect](#endpass-connect-client) library.

## Application registration

To integrate Endpass auth into your application, you first need to register it with [Endpass-vault](https://vault.endpass.com/#/apps).

### Requiried data:

|Key            |Description   |
|---------------|--------------|
|`Domain`       |The domain in which your application will be hosted|
|`RedirectUrls` |List of available redirect URLs after successful authorization|

After registration, you will receive the application client ID for future use.


## Library integration

There are two ways to install Endpass connect in your application - depending on whether you use a modular structure or not.

### CDN integration

If you want to integrate library via script tag just use provided CDN links

||
|-|
|https://unpkg.com/@endpass/connect@latest|
|https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@endpass/connect@latest|

or specify the version

||
|-|
|https://unpkg.com/@endpass/connect@0.22.1-beta|
|https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@endpass/connect@0.22.1-beta|

Add script tag to you application, before any calls to Endpass connect.

<%= partial "includes/connect/example/_import-script.md.erb" %>

After that, the Endpass connect library will be available in your js code as a root object variable. Use it as `window.EndpassConnect` or just `EndpassConnect`

Plugin for oauth will be available as `window.EndpassOauthPlugin`.

And plugin for provider usage - `window.EndpassProviderPlugin`.

[More about plugins](#plugins)

### Modular integration

First you need to install the library through the package manager.

```shell
// terminal
yarn add @endpass/connect
npm i @endpass/connect
```

After that, import it into the desired file

<%= partial "includes/connect/example/_import-module.md.erb" %>

## Creating instance

To use Endpass connect, create an instance with the constructor presented in the previous [chapter](#library-integration). Remember to pass cliends ID you recieved in the first [chapter](#application-registration) of this guide.

<%= partial "includes/connect/example/_init.md.erb" %>

## Instance usage

<%= partial "includes/connect/plugins/oauth/example/_use.md.erb" %>

You have `connect` and you are ready to get user information. Just call correct method.

For example, `connect.request('/user')` will return promise with [basic user information](#user).
